# Java-Scheduling-Algorithms

3 types of CPU scheduling algorithms are demonstrated:
1. Round Robin
2. Non Preemptive SJF
3. Non Preemptive Priority

Java is used to perform these scheduling algorithms. User will need to input the following values:
- number of process (all)
- time quantum (Round Robin)
- arrival time for each process (all)
- burst time for each process (all)
- priority for each process (Non Preemptive Priority)
